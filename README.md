- **Step 0**: If needed, the installation is explained on Youtube [here](https://youtu.be/rC-s4QdfY80)

- **Step 1**: Clone the repository using **one** of these commands:

  - If you don't have an SSH key set up:

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Folexy13/Simplicity.git && cd Simplicity
  ```

  - If you have an SSH key set up or want to add it ([guide here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account))

  ```bash
  git clone git@github.com:Folexy13/Simplicity.git && cd Simplicity
  ```



- **Step 2**: create the `backend/.env` using the `.env_sample` as a guide

  > _Your `supabase_service_key` can be found in your Supabase dashboard under Project Settings -> API. Use the `anon` `public` key found in the `Project API keys` section._

  > _Your `JWT_SECRET_KEY`can be found in your supabase settings under Project Settings -> API -> JWT Settings -> JWT Secret_

  > _To activate vertexAI with PaLM from GCP follow the instructions [here](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/models/llms/integrations/google_vertex_ai_palm.html) and update `backend/.env`- It is an advanced feature, please be expert in GCP before trying to use it_

  - [ ] Change variables in `backend/.env`

- **Step 4**: Run the following migration scripts on the Supabase database via the web interface (SQL Editor -> `New query`)

  Use the `migration.sh` script to run the migration scripts

  ```bash
  chmod +x migration.sh
  ./migration.sh
  ```

  Choose either create_scripts if it's your first time or migrations if you are updating your database.

  All the scripts can be found in the [scripts](scripts/) folder

  > _If you come from an old version of Simplicity, run the scripts in [migration script](scripts/) to migrate your data to the new version in the order of date_

- **Step 5**: Launch the app

  ```bash
  docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up --build
  ```
